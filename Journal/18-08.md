### 1st
- Did last <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of exercise 1.46
- My `iterative-improve` function:
```scheme
(define (iterative-improve good-enough? improve)
  (define (iter result)
    (if (good-enough? result (improve result))
      result
      (iter (improve result))))
  (lambda (guess) (iter guess)))`
```
- see [SICP_1.46.scm](https://github.com/flintsteel7/TMCS/tree/master/Exercises/SICP_1.46.scm) for an implementation of `fixed-point` using this

### 2nd
- Completed Week 2 including homeowork problem 2
- My `every` function:
```scheme
(define (every fun snt)
  (if (eq? (rest snt) '())
    (list (fun (first snt)))
    (append
      (list (fun (first snt)))
      (every fun (rest snt)))))
```
