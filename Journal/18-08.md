### 1st
- Did last <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of exercise 1.46
- My `iterative-improve` function:
```scheme
(define (iterative-improve good-enough? improve)
  (define (iter result)
    (if (good-enough? result (improve result))
      result
      (iter (improve result))))
  (lambda (guess) (iter guess)))`
```
- see [SICP_1.46.scm](https://github.com/flintsteel7/TMCS/tree/master/Exercises/SICP_1.46.scm) for an implementation of `fixed-point` using this

### 2nd
- Completed Week 2 including homeowork problem 2
- My `every` function:
```scheme
(define (every fun snt)
  (if (eq? (rest snt) '())
    (list (fun (first snt)))
    (append
      (list (fun (first snt)))
      (every fun (rest snt)))))
```

### 3rd
- Watched [L05 User Interface | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJB3Lk8_m7w&index=5&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)

### 4th
- Watched [L06 User Interface | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2-TaLTs7w0&index=6&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)

### 6th
- Read section 1.2 of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_

### 10th
- Watched [L07 Orders of Growth | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUaY0N4qVPY&index=7&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)
- Watched [L08 Recursion and Iteration | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOupSAT_acA&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9&index=8)

### 29th
- Attempted to do exercise 1.16. Thought I got close, but never quite figured it out.

### 31st
- Worked a long while on exercise 1.16. I ended up getting it working with exponents up through 9, but it breaks down with 10 and higher. I spent about 5 hours on it total, and decided I understand the iteration, I just don't understand the math formula necessary to get it to work, so gave up on that one.
- Did exercise 1.35, as shown below. Returns 1.61803278688525
```scheme
(define (gratio)
  (fixed-point
    (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1.0))
```
- Did exercise 1.37, as shown below. You have to give a value of k that is 11 in order to get 4-decimal place precision approximation of the 1/golden ratio
```scheme
(define (cont-frac n d k)
  (define (cf-iter n d k acc)
    (if (= k 0)
        acc
        (cf-iter n d (- k 1) (/ (n 1) (+ (d 1) acc)))))
  (cf-iter n d k 0))
```
- Did exercise 1.38, though I don't have any idea if it calculates the Euler expansion correctly.
