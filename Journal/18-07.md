# Teach Yourself Computer Science

### 5th
- Read about integrations on [MathIsFun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-definite.html) to try to understand them in order to be able to do _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ exercise 1.29

### 7th
- Watched L03 Higher Order Procedures | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010
- Watched L04 Higher Order Procedures | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010

### 9th
- Did about half of _SICP_ exercise 1.31
- Recursive analogous procedure `product`:
```scheme
(define (product fun start next stop)
  (if (equal? start stop)
    (fun stop)
    (* (fun start) (product fun (next start) next stop))
  )
)
```
- Define `factorial` in terms of `product`:
```scheme
(define (factorial x)
  (product (lambda (x) x) x (lambda (x) (- x 1)) 1))
```

### 11th
- Wrote an iterative version of the `product` function for exercise 1.31
```scheme
(define (product fun start next stop)
  (define (iter str stp result)
    (if (equal? str stp)
      result
      (iter (next str) stp (* result (fun str)))
    )
  )
  (iter start stop 1)
)
```

### 12th
- Finished exercise 1.31
- Used my `product` function to approximate pi using John Wallis' formula
```scheme
(define (approx_pi times)
  (*
    (product
      (lambda (n)
        (* (/ (* 2 n) (- (* 2 n) 1))
          (/ (* 2 n) (+ (* 2 n) 1)))
      )
      1
      (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
      times)
    2)
)
```
I noticed that my iterative version of the `product` function worked better than the recursive version. When using both to run `approx_pi` the recursive version gave a segfault around 100000, while the iterative version successfully calculated 10000000, though it took several minutes.

I'm guessing the difference has something to do with how memory is used differently with the different methods. Or maybe something's wrong with my recursive function.

### 14th
- Completed excercise 1.32 part 1
- My 1.32 `accumulate` function... see [SICP_1.32.scm](https://github.com/flintsteel7/TMCS/tree/master/Exercises/SICP_1.32.scm) for implementations of `sum` and `product` using this
```scheme
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  (define (iter a b result)
    (if (> a b)
      result
      (iter (next a) b (combiner result (term a)))
    )
  )
  (iter a b null-value)
)
```
