# Teach Yourself Computer Science
## Progress Journal

## June, 2018

### 3rd
- Read through section 1.1.3 of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Editon_
- Watched L01 Functional Programming | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010
- Install UCS STk scheme REPL

### 4th
- Read through section 1.1.6 of _SICP_
- Completed exercises 1.1 through 1.5
- My 1.2 solution:
```scheme
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```
- My 1.3 solution:
```scheme
(define (proc a b c)
  (cond ((and (> a b) (> b c)) (+ (* a a) (* b b)))
        ((and (< a b) (< b c)) (+ (* b b) (* c c)))
        ((and (> a b) (< b c)) (+ (* a a) (* c c)))))
```
- My 1.4 solution:
  - a-plus-abs-b will add a and b if b is greater than or equal to 0, but if b is less than 0, it will subtract b from a, which would be the same as addition of the absolute value of b to a. Hence a-plus-abs-b adds the absolute value of b to a, as the function name suggests.
- My 1.5 solution:
  - I believe an applicative order interpreter would not be able to evaluate Ben's expression because it would get caught in a loop and cause a fault trying to evaluate the expression `(p)` in `(test 0 (p))`, which is self-referrential. In a normal order interpreter, I belive it would not try to evaluate `(p)` in `(test 0 (p))`, since it would first determine that `(= x 0)` is true, and would not need to deal with `(p)`. I tested this in STk, and it locked up, which would indicate I was right about the applicative order. However, I don't have a way to test a normal order interpreter, so I'm just guessing there.

### 5th
- Read through section 1.1.7 of _SICP_

### 6th
- Completed exercises 1.6 through 1.7 of _SICP_
- My 1.6 solution:
  - Alyssa's `new-if` will cause a fault because, not being a special form, the interpreter will _"evaluate the arguments and then apply"_. It will attempt to evaluate both arguments to `new-if`, the consequent and alternative, before it evaluates the predicate. In Allyssa's recursive `sqrt-iter` function, the alternative is a call to itself, and with no condition to stop it, that will become an infinite loop.
- My 1.7 solution:
```scheme
(define (good-enough? guess last-guess)
  (< (/ (abs (- guess last-guess)) guess) 0.001))
(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
(define (sqrt-iter guess last-guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess last-guess)
    guess
    (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) guess x)
  )
)
(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 0.5 x))
```

### 7th
- Completed exercise 1.8 of _SICP_
- My 1.8 solution:
```scheme
(define (good-enough? guess last-guess)
  (< (/ (abs (- guess last-guess)) guess) 0.001))
(define (square x)
  (* x x))
(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))
(define (cubert-iter guess last-guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess last-guess)
    guess
    (cubert-iter (improve guess x) guess x)))
(define (cubert x)
  (cubert-iter 1.0 0.5 x))
```

### 8th
- Read section 1.1.8
- Watched L02 Functional Programming | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010

### 11th
- My solution to _CS 61A Week 1 Homework_ exercise 2
```scheme
(define (square x)
  (* x x))
(define (squarel x)
  (list (square x))
)
(define (squares lst)
  (if (eq? (rest lst) '())
    (squarel (first lst))
    (append
      (squarel (first lst))
      (squares (rest lst))
    )
  )
)
```

### 12th
- My solution to exercise 3 _CS 61A Week 1 Homework_
  - if first of snt is 'You' return 'I'
  - if first of snt is 'you' return 'me'
  - if first of snt is 'I' or 'me' return 'you'
```scheme
(define (swapper wd)
  (cond [(eq? wd 'you) 'me]
    [(or (eq? wd 'i) (eq? wd 'me)) 'you]
    [else wd]
  )
)
(define (switch-iter snt)
  (if [eq? (length snt) 1]
    [list (swapper (first snt))]
    [append
      (list (swapper (first snt)))
      (switch-iter (rest snt))
    ]
  )
)
(define (switch snt)
  (cond [(eq? (first snt) 'you)
      (append '(i) (switch-iter (rest snt)))]
    [else (switch-iter (rest snt))]
  )
)
```
- My solution to exercise 4
  - if first of list is > first of rest of list: return false
  - if first of list is < first of rest of list: proceed
  - if length of list is 1: return true
```scheme
(define (ordered? numlst)
  (if [eq? (length numlst) 1]
    #t
    (cond [(< (first numlst) (first (rest numlst)))
        (ordered? (rest numlst))]
      [else #f]
    )
  )
)
```

### 13th
- My solution to exercise 5 _CS 61A Week 1 Homework_
```scheme
(define (eword wd)
  (if [eq? (last wd) 'e]
    (list wd)
    '()
  )
)
(define (ends-e snt)
  (if [eq? (length snt) 1]
    [eword snt]
    [append
      (eword (first snt))
      (ends-e (rest snt))
    ]
  )
)
```
- Read section 1.3.1 in _SICP_

### 19th
- Read the rest of section 1.3 in _SICP_ and am getting discouraged, 'cause I don't understand most of the math they're using in the examples, and require me to know for the exercises.
