### 3rd
- added proper solutions to exercises 1.16 and 1.38 I found on [sicp-solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-solutions)
- did homework week 3 exercise 2:
```scheme
(define (next-perf n)
  (define (perf-iter num sum-facts)
    (if (eq? num sum-facts)
        num
        (perf-iter (+ num 1) (factor-sum (factors (+ num 1))))))
  (perf-iter n (factor-sum (factors n))))
```
- read SICP section 2.1
- did exercise 2.7:
```scheme
(define (upper-bound interval)
  (cdr interval))

(define (lower-bound interval)
  (car interval))
```

### 4th
- did exercise 2.8: Analogous to Alyssa's `add-interval` procedure, I'd define the `sub-interval` procedure as returning an interval whose lower bound is the difference of the lower bounds of intervals `x` and `y`, and whose upper bound is the difference of the upper bounds of intervals `x` and `y` like so:
```scheme
(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (upper-bound x)
                    (upper-bound y))
                 (- (lower-bound x)
                    (lower-bound y)))
```
- did exercise 2.10:
```scheme
(define (spans-zero? x)
  (if (and (>= 0 (lower-bound x))
          (<= 0 (upper-bound x)))
    #t
    #f))

(define (div-interval x y)
  (if (not (spans-zero? y))
      (mul-interval x
                    (make-interval
                      (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                      (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y))))
      (error "cannot divide by an interval that spans zero")))
```

### 10th
- completed exercise 2.12: Define a constructor make-center-percent that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces the desired interval. You must also define a selector percent that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval.
```scheme
(define (make-center-percent center percentage)
  (make-interval
    (- center (* center percentage))
    (+ center (* center percentage))))

(define (percent interval)
 (/ (- (upper-bound interval) (center interval)) (center interval)))
```
- read section 2.2 up to exercise 2.17
