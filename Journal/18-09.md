- added proper solutions to exercises 1.16 and 1.38 I found on [sicp-solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-solutions)
- did homework week 3 exercise 2:
```scheme
(define (next-perf n)
  (define (perf-iter num sum-facts)
    (if (eq? num sum-facts)
        num
        (perf-iter (+ num 1) (factor-sum (factors (+ num 1))))))
  (perf-iter n (factor-sum (factors n))))
```
