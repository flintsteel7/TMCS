### 3rd
- added proper solutions to exercises 1.16 and 1.38 I found on [sicp-solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-solutions)
- did homework week 3 exercise 2:
```scheme
(define (next-perf n)
  (define (perf-iter num sum-facts)
    (if (eq? num sum-facts)
        num
        (perf-iter (+ num 1) (factor-sum (factors (+ num 1))))))
  (perf-iter n (factor-sum (factors n))))
```
- read SICP section 2.1
- did exercise 2.7:
```scheme
(define (upper-bound interval)
  (cdr interval))

(define (lower-bound interval)
  (car interval))
```

### 4th
- did exercise 2.8: Analogous to Alyssa's `add-interval` procedure, I'd define the `sub-interval` procedure as returning an interval whose lower bound is the difference of the lower bounds of intervals `x` and `y`, and whose upper bound is the difference of the upper bounds of intervals `x` and `y` like so:
```scheme
(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (upper-bound x)
                    (upper-bound y))
                 (- (lower-bound x)
                    (lower-bound y)))
```
- did exercise 2.10:
```scheme
(define (spans-zero? x)
  (if (and (>= 0 (lower-bound x))
          (<= 0 (upper-bound x)))
    #t
    #f))

(define (div-interval x y)
  (if (not (spans-zero? y))
      (mul-interval x
                    (make-interval
                      (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                      (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y))))
      (error "cannot divide by an interval that spans zero")))
```

### 10th
- completed exercise 2.12: Define a constructor `make-center-percent` that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces the desired interval. You must also define a selector `percent` that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval.
```scheme
(define (make-center-percent center percentage)
  (make-interval
    (- center (* center percentage))
    (+ center (* center percentage))))

(define (percent interval)
 (/ (- (upper-bound interval) (center interval)) (center interval)))
```
- read section 2.2 up to exercise 2.17

### 11th
- did exercise 2.17: define a procedure `last-pair` that returns the list that of a given (nonempty) list
```scheme
(define (last-pair lst)
  (if (null? (cdr lst))
      (list (car lst))
      (last-pair (cdr lst))))
```
- completed exercise 2.20: write a procedure `same-parity` that takes one or more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same even-odd parity as the first argument
```scheme
(define (parity n . l)
  (let ((eve (even? n)))
    (define (parity-iter lst res)
      (cond ((null? lst)
              res)
            ((or
                (and eve (even? (car lst)))
                (and (not eve) (not (even? (car lst)))))
              (parity-iter (cdr lst) (append res (list (car lst)))))
            (else
              (parity-iter (cdr lst) res))))
    (parity-iter l '())))
```

### 12th
- finished reading section 2.2.1
- exercise 2.22 answers:
  - Louis's first attempt produces a backwards list because of the way cons works, and that lists are actually chains of pairs where the first element of the pair points to an item, while the second points to the next pair. He passes the newly created square as the first argument to cons, and the list of already-created squares as the second argment. Cons returns a pair where the new square is pointed to by the first element, and the second element points to the list of squares, which is actually a sequence of pairs. The result is the numbers are appended to the front of the list rather than the end.
  - Louis's attempted fix doesn't do what he wants because he hasn't taken into account how cons and lists work. He's now passing the list of existing squares as the first argument to cons. Cons returns a new pair where the first element of the first pair points to the passed in list of squares, and the second element of the first pair points to the second argument given to cons, namely the newly created square. So the squares end up in the correct order, but each subsequent square added to the list nests the existing list as the first element of a pair, with the second element of the pair being the new square.
- did exercise 2.23: Give an implementation of `for-each`
```scheme
(define (for-each fun lst)
  (cond ((null? lst)
      :okay)
      (else (for-each fun (cdr lst))
            (fun (car lst)))))
```

### 13th
- watched [L09 Data Abstraction | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LIZqnf7gIs&index=9&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)

### 14th
- watched [L10 Sequences | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50z10gewhs&index=10&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9)
- watched [L11 Example Calculator | UC Berkeley CS 61A, Spring 2010](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj8Y8pvs-6I&list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9&index=11)

### 24th
- read _SICP_ 2.2.2
- did exercise 2.24:
```scheme
(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))
```
returns:
```scheme
(1 (2 (3 4)))
```
The box-and-pointer structure and the tree graph are shown in [Execises/SICP_2.24.png](https://github.com/flintsteel7/TMCS/tree/master/Exercises/SICP_2.24.png)
- did exercise 2.26:
```scheme
(define x (list 1 2 3))
(define y (list 4 5 6))
```
```scheme
(append x y)

(1 2 3 4 5 6)
```

```scheme
(cons x y)

((1 2 3) 4 5 6)
```

```scheme
(list x y)

((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
```
